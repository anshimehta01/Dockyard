# 🚀 Deploying a Streamlit App Using Docker 🐳  

Welcome to this guide on containerizing and deploying a Streamlit web application using Docker.  
With this setup, you can run your Streamlit app anywhere, hassle-free.  

## 📌 Why Use Docker?  
✅ Portability – Run your app on any system without dependency issues.  
✅ Isolation – No interference with your local environment.  
✅ Easy Deployment – Move from development to production smoothly.  

## 🛠 Prerequisites  
Before starting, ensure you have:  
🔹 Docker installed → [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
🔹 Python installed → [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
🔹 Streamlit installed (inside your app)  

## 🚀 Setup & Installation  

### 🔹 1. Clone This Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/streamlit-docker.git
cd streamlit-docker

🔹 2. Build the Docker Image
docker build -t streamlit_app .

🔹 3. Run the Docker Container
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit_app

🔹 4. Access the Streamlit App
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8501

📝 Project Structure
streamlit-docker/
│-- app.py          # Your Streamlit application
│-- Dockerfile      # Docker setup instructions
│-- requirements.txt # Dependencies
│-- README.md       # This guide 🚀

🛠 Troubleshooting
❌ Port Already in Use?
Try stopping the process using port 8501:
sudo fuser -k 8501/tcp

Then re-run the container.

❌ Streamlit App Not Loading?
Check running containers:
docker ps
